    <h1>History Of Giraffes</h1>
    <p>Giraffes are long-necked cud-chewing mammals of Africa, with long legs and coat pattern of irregular brown patches on a light background. They are the tallest of all living terrestrial animals and the largest on Earth. </p>
    <p>Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements.</p>
    <p>Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.</p>

    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
    <p>The giraffe is one of only two living genera of the family Giraffidae in the order Artiodactyla, the other being the okapi. The family was once much more extensive, with over 10 fossil genera described.The elongation of the neck appears to have started early in the giraffe lineage. </p>
    <p>Comparisons between giraffes and their ancient relatives suggest vertebrae close to the skull lengthened earlier, followed by lengthening of vertebrae further down. One early giraffid ancestor was Canthumeryx which has been dated variously to have lived 25-20 million years ago,this animal was medium-sized, slender and antelope-like.</p>
    <p>Some researchers have hypothesised that this new habitat coupled with a different diet, including acacia species, may have exposed giraffe ancestors to toxins that caused higher mutation rates and a higher rate of evolution. The coat patterns of modern giraffes may also have coincided with these habitat changes.</p>

    <h3>Species and subspecies</h3>
    <p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) currently recognises only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies.During the 1900s, various taxonomies with two or three species were proposed. A 2007 study on the genetics of giraffes using mitochondrial DNA suggested at least six lineages could be recognised as species.</p>
    <p>A 2011 study using detailed analyses of the morphology of giraffes, and application of the phylogenetic species concept, described eight species of living giraffes. The researchers suggested the existence of four species, which have not exchanged genetic information between each other for 1 to 2 million years.</p>
    <p>A 2020 study showed that depending on the method chosen, different taxonomic hypotheses recognizing from two to six species can be considered for the genus Giraffa. That study also found that multi-species coalescent methods can lead to taxonomic over-splitting, as those methods delimit geographic structures rather than species.</p>

    <h4>Appearance and anatomy</h4>
    <p>Fully grown giraffes stand 4.3-5.7 m (14.1-18.7 ft) tall, with males taller than females.The average weight is 1,192 kg (2,628 lb) for an adult male and 828 kg (1,825 lb) for an adult female.Despite its long neck and legs, its body is relatively short.The skin is mostly gray, or tan,and can reach a thickness of 20 mm</p>
    <p>Both sexes have prominent horn-like structures called ossicones, formed from ossified cartilage, covered in skin and fused to the skull at the parietal bones.Being vascularised, the ossicones may have a role in thermoregulation,and are used in combat between males.Appearance is a reliable guide to the sex or age of a giraffe.</p>
    <p>A giraffe's front and back legs are about the same length. The radius and ulna of the front legs are articulated by the carpus, which, while structurally equivalent to the human wrist, functions as a knee. It appears that a suspensory ligament allows the lanky legs to support the animal's great weight.</p>

    <h5>Behaviour and ecology</h5>
    <p>Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and open woodlands. They prefer Acacieae, Commiphora, Combretum and open Terminalia woodlands over denser environments like Brachystegia woodlands. The Angolan giraffe can be found in desert environments</p>
    <p>Giraffes browse on the twigs of trees, preferring those of the subfamily Acacieae and the genera Commiphora and Terminalia,which are important sources of calcium and protein to sustain the giraffe's growth rate. When stressed, giraffes may chew the bark off branches. Giraffes are also recorded to chew old bones.</p>
    <p>During the wet season, food is abundant and giraffes are more spread out, while during the dry season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably to make it easier to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency.</p>

    <h6>Reproduction</h6>
    <p>Reproduction in giraffes is broadly polygamous: a few older males mate with the fertile females. Females can reproduce throughout the year and experience oestrus cycling approximately every 15 days.Female giraffes in oestrous are dispersed over space and time, so reproductive adult males adopt a strategy of roaming among female groups to seek mating opportunities.</p>
    <p>Male giraffes assess female fertility by tasting the female's urine to detect oestrus, in a multi-step process known as the flehmen response. Once an oestrous female is detected, the male will attempt to court her. When courting, dominant males will keep subordinate ones at bay. Males prefer young adult females over juveniles and older adults.</p>
    <p>Giraffe gestation lasts 400-460 days, after which a single calf is normally born, although twins occur on rare occasions.The mother gives birth standing up. The calf emerges head and front legs first, having broken through the fetal membranes, and falls to the ground, severing the umbilical cord.</p>
